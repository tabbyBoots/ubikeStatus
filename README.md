  2. **Backend Pipeline**: Restore packages → Build with .NET 9 → Run tests → Upload artifacts
  3. **Docker Pipeline**: Multi-architecture build → Push to GitHub Container Registry
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: AMD64 and ARM64 container images
- **Caching**: Optimized build times with GitHub Actions cache
- **Artifact Management**: Build artifacts stored for deployment

**Container Images**: Available at `ghcr.io/[username]/[repository]`

The workflow configuration is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### Local Testing

Use the provided test script to build and run the application in a local Docker container. It automates environment variable and certificate password management.
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x test-docker.sh
./test-docker.sh
```

## 📊 Data Source

This application uses the official Taipei City uBike API:
- **API URL**: `https://tcgbusfs.blob.core.windows.net/dotapp/youbike/v2/youbike_immediate.json`
- **Data Provider**: Taipei City Government
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time updates
- **Official Dataset**: [Taipei Open Data Portal](https://data.taipei/dataset/detail?id=c6bc8aed-557d-41d5-bfb1-8da24f78f2fb)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Frontend** (optional):
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

**Backend** (Docker deployment):
```bash
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:8443;http://+:8080
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
SSL_CERT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=${SSL_CERT_PASSWORD}
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx
```

### Google Maps API Setup (Optional)

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the **Maps JavaScript API** and the **Directions API**.
4. Create an API key with appropriate restrictions.
5. Add the key to your environment variables.

**Note**: The application includes Leaflet/OpenStreetMap as a fallback if Google Maps API is not configured.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

### 1. Google Maps `RefererNotAllowedMapError`

**Issue**: The map appears blank, and the console shows `RefererNotAllowedMapError`. This means your Google Maps API key is not authorized for the domain you are accessing the application from.

**Solution**:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
3. Select the API key you are using.
4. Under "Application restrictions", ensure "HTTP referrers (web sites)" is selected.
5. Add `https://localhost:8443/*` (or the specific URL you are using) to the list of "Website restrictions". The `*` is crucial to allow all paths under that origin.
6. **If running in Docker**: After updating the API key restrictions, you must rebuild your Docker image to ensure the frontend picks up the latest configuration.
   ```bash
   docker stop ubike-test && docker rm ubike-test # Stop and remove old container
   docker rmi ubike-app-test # Remove old image
   ./test-docker.sh # Rebuild and run
   ```

### 2. Docker Container Fails with `CryptographicException`
**Issue**: The Docker container fails to start, and logs show `System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: The certificate data cannot be read with the provided password, the password may be incorrect.`
**Solution**: This error occurs when the password used to create the SSL certificate during the Docker build does not match the password provided at runtime.
- The `test-docker.sh` script handles this automatically by using the same password for both build and run.
- If building manually, ensure you pass the `SSL_CERT_PASSWORD` as a build argument and as an environment variable:
  ```bash
  # Use the same password for both build-arg and env var
  export SSL_PASS="your_secure_password"
  docker build --build-arg SSL_CERT_PASSWORD="$SSL_PASS" -t ubike-app .
  docker run -e SSL_CERT_PASSWORD="$SSL_PASS" ... ubike-app
  ```

### 3. Backend Fails with `ArgumentException: Decoded string is not a valid IDN name`
**Issue**: The application fails to start, particularly in a Docker environment, with an error related to an invalid IDN name.
**Solution**: This is caused by an invalid value in the `AllowedHosts` configuration. For Docker, the host needs to be explicitly defined.
- The `test-docker.sh` script sets `ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost` automatically.
- If running manually, add `-e ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost` to your `docker run` command.
- For non-Docker environments, check the `AllowedHosts` setting in `appsettings.json` or any `ASPNETCORE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable.

### 4. Map Appears Blank with `TypeError: IntersectionObserver.observe: Argument 1 is not an object.`

**Issue**: When opening the map modal or switching back from Street View, the map area is blank, and the console shows an `IntersectionObserver` error. This indicates a timing issue where the Google Maps API tries to initialize on a DOM element that is not yet fully rendered or available.

**Solution**: This issue has been addressed in the application code by implementing a robust waiting mechanism that ensures the map container element is fully ready before the map initialization proceeds. If you encounter this after pulling the latest changes, ensure your local repository is up-to-date.
